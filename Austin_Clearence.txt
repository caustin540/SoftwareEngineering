I particularly like the emulation support part as I fondly remember discovering the existence of game emuation apps for older consoles such as the Gameboy Advance and Super Nintendo on my smartphone years ago.

Pokemon Showdown is a website that simulates Pokemon battles with online opponents and has an array of features and customization options with a focus on competitive battling.
